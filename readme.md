# On the square peg problem

This repository contains programs and code related to the author's article "[On the Square Peg problem and some Relatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0186)".

- `Square Peg Applet`:
  A Java applet that computes the inscribed squares and rectangles for a given 'smooth' and PL Jordan curve.
  If your browser supports Java applets, see e.g. [https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmatschke/squarepeg2/index.php](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmatschke/squarepeg2/index.php).

- `Square Peg Program`:
  The same, now as an executable java program. 

- `Inscribed Octahedra`:
  Computations in Maple and SageMath that were used in the last section of the article to prove the existence of the test-map in question for octahedra inscribed in metric 2-spheres.
  
- `Inscribed Rectangles`:
  - SageMath script that shows that the (up to symmetry) two inscribed rectangles in an ellipse (not a circle) have the opposite preimage orientation when using a natural configuration-space/test-map scheme.
  - SageMath script that studies the one-dimensional components of inscribed rectangles with arbitrary aspect ratio; tried to construct counter-examples based on Z/4-invariant components (which is now obsolete by Greene--Lobb's theorem).
