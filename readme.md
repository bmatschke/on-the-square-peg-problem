# On the square peg problem

This repository contains programs and code related to the author's article "[On the Square Peg problem and some Relatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0186)".

- `Square Peg Applet`:
  A Java applet that computes the inscribed squares and rectangles for a given 'smooth' and PL Jordan curve.
  If your browser supports Java applets, see e.g. [https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmatschke/squarepeg2/index.php](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmatschke/squarepeg2/index.php).

- `Square Peg Program`:
  The same, now as an executable java program. 

- `Inscribed Octahedra`:
  Computations in Maple and SageMath that were used in the last section of the article to prove the existence of the test-map in question for octahedra inscribed in metric 2-spheres.
